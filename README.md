Malicious URL Detection using Machine Learning

# **What is URL?**
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the well-defined structured format unique address for accessing websites over World Wide Web (WWW).

Generally, there are three basic components that make up a legitimate URL

i.) **Protocol**: It is basically an identifier that determines what protocol to use e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, etc.

ii) **Hostname**: Also known as the resource name. It contains the IP address or the domain name where the actual resource is located.

iii) **Path**: It specifies the actual path where the resource is located

**Defacement URLs**: Defacement URLs are generally created by hackers with the intention of breaking into a web server and replacing the hosted website with one of their own, using techniques such as code injection, cross-site scripting, etc. Common targets of defacement URLs are religious websites, government websites, bank websites, and corporate websites. Some of the examples of defacement URLs are as follows:
